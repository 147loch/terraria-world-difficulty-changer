# Terraria World Difficulty Changer

Use this tool to change the difficulty settings for your worlds (.wld) files.

Grab the latest compiled executable under the Releases tab.

## How does it work?

Download the .exe app [here](https://github.com/147loch/terraria-world-difficulty-changer/releases), go to Documents > My Games > Terraria > Worlds and drag the world you want to the executable. This will open a console window and you just need to follow the instructions.
